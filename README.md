# About this project

This is a'speak number guessing' game in which the user interacts with the website via the 'SpeechRecognition' API. This web application was created with HTML CSS and Pure JavaScript.
## How it works
First, we need a random number (between 1 and 100), and then the user will speak a number. If both match, the guess is correct, and a congratulations message appears ``('body.documnet.innerHTML')``. If the user says higher, a text will appear indicating that the user's guess number is greater than the computer's random number. similar to the lower number case

I used the``speechRecognition`` API for speech recognition.
